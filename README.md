# Deep Learning for Spectroscopic Ellipsometry – Inverse Modeling with PyTorch

This project explores the use of deep neural networks to solve the **inverse problem** in **spectroscopic ellipsometry** – the task of recovering **optical properties** (refractive index `n` and extinction coefficient `k`) of a material from experimentally measured ellipsometric data (`ψ`, `Δ`, wavelength, etc.).

## Project Goal

To assess the feasibility of using **deep learning (MLP neural networks)** to predict material-specific properties from ellipsometric spectra, bypassing the need for traditional model-based fitting.
